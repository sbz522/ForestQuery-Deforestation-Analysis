# ForestQuery-Deforestation-Analysis

# Introduction:
This project aims to analyze the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016. The goal is to identify countries and regions that have experienced a decline in forest area and also determine the countries and regions with the largest forest area in terms of both total amount and percentage of total area. The findings will inform ForestQuery's initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the most significant impact with their limited resources.

# Data Sources:
Tables of data from various sources, dealing with forestation, total land area, and region groupings, were brought together into a database for querying.


# Methodology:
The analysis will be conducted using SQL queries on the database to obtain relevant data.

# Expected Outcome:
The ForestQuery executive team will be presented with a comprehensive report containing complete sentences that summarize the findings from the analysis. The report will enable the executive team to make informed decisions on initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to reduce deforestation worldwide.
